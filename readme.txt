Regatta Scoring Software by Simon Boeger

Sail numbers as they finish are inputted into the 'results.txt' file in a specific format. Standings for overall and each fleet are then calculated based on the US Racing Rules of Sailing, including throwouts (according to the sailing instructions) and tiebreakers.

A list of sailor names, sail numbers, and coaches are provided in 'sailorList.txt'.
An example for how 'results.txt' should be constructed is 'resultsExample.txt'.
'script.py' is the python code that calculates the standings from the above text files.

Reconstructed from a new paradime of input through text files instead of direct input to the script, which should make it more user friendly.

Software will be used to score the upcoming Encinal Yacht Club opti regatta simulation in the Oakland estuary July 22-23, as well as future in-house events.
